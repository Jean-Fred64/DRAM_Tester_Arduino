# DRAM_Tester_Arduino
DRAM Tester Shield for Arduino Uno/Nano

I made a PCB for the project on this site: https://forum.defence-force.org/viewtopic.php?p=15035

You can download the PCB from PCBWAY: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/DRAM_Test_Shield_for_Arduino_Uno_and_Nano.html

Currently works for 4164 and 41256 DRAM Modules

This PCB is tested and works okay!

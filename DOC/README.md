# How to test 4164 / 41256 with DRAM TESTER Arduino

## Quick procedure


Power ON arduino board (USB plug in)

Install a chip (4164 or 41256) on tester

:heavy_check_mark: **Mind the right position of chip** :heavy_check_mark:

Pin 1 and notch up near LEDs or arduino USB plug in

Push **START** button

LEDs (RED and GREEN) flashing during the test :high_brightness: :high_brightness:

:alarm_clock: A few moments later :alarm_clock:

:eight_spoked_asterisk: GREEN = RAM OK

:red_circle: RED = RAM ERROR

## DÃ©tailed test  

Install / Open Arduino IDE

Menu *"TOOLS"* 

Select Board: *"Arduino AVR Boards"*

**Arduino Nano** for this documentation

Select Ports: **COM14** for example

if you want a very slow refresh test then use "**slow**" TEST version

```
dramarduino_new_slowTEST.ino
```

if you want normal refresh test then use "**normal**" TEST version


```
dramarduino_new_normalTEST.ino
```

Open "**Serial Monitor**" to show data of the DRAM TESTER Arduino
